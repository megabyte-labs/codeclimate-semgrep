# codeclimate-semgrep

A [Code Climate analysis engine](https://docs.codeclimate.com/docs/building-a-code-climate-engine)
for running [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev) against your code.

## Description

This engine is used to run Semgrep rules against your code, allowing for custom
static analysis on multiple languages. Due to licensing it doesn't ship with the
[community-created Semgrep rules](https://github.com/returntocorp/semgrep-rules),
but you're free to use these in your own project.

## Getting Started

The engine itself is written in Python and wrapped up in a Docker container. To
build the container:

```
$ make build-docker TAG=latest TARGET=release
```

You can then test it using the `--dev` flag to the Code Climate CLI, e.g.

```
$ cat .codeclimate.yml
version: "2"
plugins:
  semgrep:
    enabled: true
    runs:
      - configs: ["rules/lang/correctness"]
$ codeclimate analyze --dev -f html > /tmp/out.html
```

To test or develop the engine, you can build the container to its `development`
target and bring up a shell:

```
$ make build-docker
